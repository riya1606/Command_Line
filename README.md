# Command_Line
The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. You can use it to traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem. Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and more!
On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash.

### A. Filesystem
A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure:
<br/>
1. The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
<br/>
2. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. In the filesystem on the right, blog/ is the parent of 2014/, 2015/, and hardware.txt.
<br/>
3. Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.
<br/>

You’re probably already familiar with this tree structure - Mac Finder and Windows Explorer represent the filesystem as trees as well.
